### Word Clouds of APSC200 Reports

Word clouds of sample quotes taken from APSC200 reports marked using VALUE rubrics. Shiny app allows you to choose an engineering discipline, and a VALUE rubric level(Benchmark 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, or Capstone 4), and displays a wordcloud of the quotes taken to be representitive of that level for a certain criteria.

Running the app and getting ```Error:invalid 'cex' value``` means that no quotes were taken from the chosen discipline that corresponded to the chosen level.
